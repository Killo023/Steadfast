# Hero video

To use a background video in the hero section:

1. Download a free stock video from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/firearm%20training/) or [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/videos/search/shooting%20range/).
2. Save the file as `hero.mp4` in this folder (`public/video/hero.mp4`).

Suggested Pexels videos:
- [Woman firing a rifle](https://www.pexels.com/video/woman-firing-a-rifle-6090891/)
- [Man shooting in firing range](https://www.pexels.com/video/a-man-shooting-in-the-firing-range-6092117/)

If no video is present, the hero will show a static image instead.
